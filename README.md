# Stray Programs 

A repo for stray programs. 

Not sure what kind of programs will be here. But I guess that's the point.


## FantasyHits

Program to count point hits taken by top 1k managers in [FantasyPremierLeague](fantasy.premierleague.com).

Run `fetch_players.py` followed by `count_hits.py` and then `visualize.py`. 

## SimpleNN

A very basic Neural Network based on [this blog post](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).
